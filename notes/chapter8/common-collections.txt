Collections
  - Rust's standard library contains useful data structures called collections

  - Three collections that are used very often in Rust programs:
  	1. vector: allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other
	2. string: a collection of characters
	3. hash map: allows you to associate a value with a particular key
