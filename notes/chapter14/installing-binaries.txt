Installing Bianries from Crates.io with cargo install
  - The 'cargo install' command allows you to install and use binary crates locally
    -- this isn't intended to replace system packages; it's meant to be a convenient way for
	   Rust developers to install tools that other have shared on crates.io

    -- note that you can only install packages that have binary targets
	   * a binary target is the runnable program that is created if the crate has a src/main.rs file
	   	 or another file specified as a binary, as opposed to a library target that isn't runnable
		 on its own but is suitable for including within other programs


  - all binaries installed with 'cargo install' are stored in the installation root's bin folder

  - example: we can install ripgrep as follows
  	  '$ cargo install ripgrep'
