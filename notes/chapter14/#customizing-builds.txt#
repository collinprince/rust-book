Customizing Builds with Release Profiles
  - release profiles are predefined and customizable profiles with different configurations that allow
  	a programmer to have more control over various options for compiling code

  - each profile is configured independently of the others
  

  - Cargo has two main profiles:
    -- dev: profile Cargo uses when you run 'cargo build'
	-- release: profile Cargo uses when you run 'cargo build --release'

  - the dev profile is defined with good defaults for development, and the release profile
  	has good defaults for release builds


  - Cargo has default settings for each of the profiles that apply when there aren't any [profile.*]
  	sections in the project's Cargo.toml file

  - in Cargo.toml, the following default profiles exist (code):

      [profile.dev]
	  opt-level = 0

	  [profile.release]
	  opt-level = 3

  - opt-level: the number of optimizations Rust will apply to your code, with a range of 0 to 3
    -- the higher the optimization, the longer the code will take to compile generally

  - you can override any default setting by addin ga different value for it in Cargo.toml
    -- for example, we can update our dev profile to have opt-level = 1
