When our logic in main.rs starts to get complicated:
  - split your program into a main.rs and a lib.rs and move your program's logic to lib.rs
  - as long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in main.rs
  - when the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it from main.rs and
  	move it to lib.rs


Responsibilities of main:
  - calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values
  - setting up any other configuration
  - calling a run function in lib.rs
  - handling the error if run returns an error
